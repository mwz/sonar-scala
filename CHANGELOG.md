Changelog
===
## [7.1.0](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v7.1.0) - 19.11.2018
- Added support for [SonarQube 7.4](https://www.sonarqube.org/sonarqube-7-4). (#127 - @mwz)
## [7.0.0](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v7.0.0) - 08.10.2018
- Added support for [SonarQube 7.3](https://www.sonarqube.org/sonarqube-7-3). The current `6.x` series targeting *SonarQube 6.7 LTS* will be still maintained and will follow the SonarQube LTS lifecycle. (#120 - @mwz)
- Removed the following:
  - `sonar.scoverage.reportPath` property which was deprecated in [6.2.0](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v6.2.0) - please use `sonar.scala.scoverage.reportPath` instead;
  - the old Scalastyle quality profile and rule registry which were deprecated in [6.6.0](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v6.6.0); (#120 - @mwz)
- Bumped up the default value of the `sonar.scala.version` property to `2.12`. (#120 - @mwz)

## [6.6.0](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v6.6.0) - 30.09.2018
- Refactored Scalastyle module and introduced new Scalastyle rules repository along with a new quality profile, which now in addition to the latest Scalastyle rules also consists of rule templates which are activated by default. The existing Scalastyle quality profile and rule registry have been deprecated and will be removed in the next major version of the plugin (7.x). The new module also exposes the following optional property `sonar.scala.scalastyle.disable`, which allows you to disable the Scalastyle sensor. (#35 - @mwz)
- New `Scalastyle+Scapegoat` quality profile, which includes all of the default rules from Scalastyle and Scapegoat quality profiles. (#112 - @BalmungSan)
- Bumped Scapegoat up to `1.3.7`, which introduces a new inspection ([UnsafeStringContains](https://github.com/sksamuel/scapegoat/blob/v1.3.7/src/main/scala/com/sksamuel/scapegoat/inspections/string/UnsafeStringContains.scala)) and other various fixes and improvements - see the [diff](https://github.com/sksamuel/scapegoat/compare/v1.3.5...v1.3.7) for more details. (#100 - @mwz)
- Scapegoat sensor now also works with absolute file paths in the Scapegoat report. (#116 - @mwz)

## [6.5.1](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v6.5.1) - 11.08.2018
- This release fixes an issue with Scapegoat sensor using a single report for each module in multi-module projects. (#96 - @mwz)

## [6.5.0](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v6.5.0) - 09.07.2018
- Introduced support for [Scapegoat](https://github.com/sksamuel/scapegoat) linter. This version of the plugin ships with a **Scapegoat** rule repository, quality profile as well as a new sensor, which reads the xml report generated by Scapegoat and submits Scapegoat issues to SonarQube. To use this feature, you need to set up Scapegoat in your project and make sure you generate a Scapegoat report before running `sonar-scanner`, see [sbt-scapegoat](https://github.com/sksamuel/sbt-scapegoat) for SBT integration. This feature exposes the following optional properties:
  - `sonar.scala.scapegoat.reportPath` - relative path to the scapegoat report (defaults to `target/scala-${sonar.scala.version}/scapegoat-report/scapegoat.xml`) and
  - `sonar.scala.scapegoat.disable` - which allows you to disable the Scapegoat sensor from being executed on your sources (defaults to `false`)

  A massive thanks to @BalmungSan for implementing this feature! (#8 - @BalmungSan, @mwz)

## [6.4.0](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v6.4.0) - 23.05.2018
- Improved logging in the Scoverage sensor. (#61 - @BalmungSan)
- Fixed Scoverage issues with multi-module Gradle projects. Please see the [examples](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/tree/master/examples) for a reference on how to configure Gradle projects and how to execute SonarQube analysis. (#63 - @mwz)

## [6.3.0](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v6.3.0) - 12.05.2018
- Use semantic versioning scheme to parse the `sonar.scala.version` property. The patch version is now ignored and `2.11` and `2.12` are valid version numbers. In case of a missing value or an incorrect version the property defaults to `2.11.0`. (#53 - @BalmungSan)
- Fixed an issue which affected Gradle users and caused the sonar sources prefix `sonar.sources` to be appended twice to filenames in the Scoverage report. (#56 - @mwz)

## [6.2.0](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v6.2.0) - 28.04.2018
- Added support for multiple source locations configured by the `sonar.sources` property. As per SonarQube [documentation](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Analysis+Parameters), the paths should be separated by a comma. Additionally, the paths can now be absolute, which allows sonar-scala to work with [SonarQube Maven plugin](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner+for+Maven). (#52 - @mwz)
- The Scoverage report path property `sonar.scoverage.reportPath` was deprecated and will be removed in the next major version. Please use `sonar.scala.scoverage.reportPath` instead. (#46 - @BalmungSan)

## [6.1.0](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v6.1.0) - 28.03.2018
- The Scoverage sensor was rewritten from scratch; introduced a new branch coverage metric. (#34 - @BalmungSan)
- Addressed coverage measure warnings reported by sonar-scanner during analysis. (#18 - @BalmungSan)
- Added a new property `sonar.scala.version` to specify Scala version. (#2 - @ElfoLiNk)

## [6.0.0](https://github.com/mwz/sonar-scala/releases/tag/v6.0.0) - 10.02.2018
- Support for SonarQube 6.7.1 LTS. (#5 - @mwz)
